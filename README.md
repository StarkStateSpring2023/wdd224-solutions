# Active Server Page Web Development Solutions and Example Repo

As we move through the semester, any example code that is used in Lecture Videos will be posted in the corresponding weeks folder
Also after each weeks projects have been graded, I will post my solution to the lab so you can see what my expectations are and compare against how you solved the problem.

Please feel free to dowload and use to help you understand the concepts in class better.

 If you have questions don't hesitate to comment on the repo itself or reach out.
